# Square Algorithms

### Motivation

When procedurally generating 2D maps, square algorithms can come in very handy. This little library provides you various ways of traversing squares. Check out the example project to see all the variations.

### Example

```
git clone git@github.com:lukezirngibl/square-algorithms.git
cd square-algorithms/example
yarn install
yarn start
```

### Install

```
yarn add square-algorithms
```
```
npm install square-algorithms
```
